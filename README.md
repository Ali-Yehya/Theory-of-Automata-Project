# Regex to DFA Converter (GUI)

A Python GUI application that **converts a regular expression into a minimized DFA**, using **McNaughton-Yamada-Thompson construction** to build an Îµ-NFA, **subset construction** to generate a DFA, and **Hopcroft's algorithm** to minimize it. The resulting DFA is rendered using Graphviz and displayed in a Tkinter GUI.

## Features  
- Convert regular expressions to minimized DFA  
- Visualize DFA as a state graph using Graphviz  
- Interactive **Tkinter GUI** for input/output  
- Supports `|`, `*`, `+`, concatenation, and parentheses  
- Includes built-in examples  
- Real-time status updates during conversion  
- Outputs number of states, start state, accept states, and transitions

## Supported Operators
| â†’ Union (OR)

* â†’ Kleene Star (zero or more)

+ â†’ One or more

() â†’ Grouping

Concatenation is implicit (e.g., ab = a followed by b)

## How It Works
Regex â†’ Îµ-NFA: Using Thompson's Construction

Îµ-NFA â†’ DFA: Using Subset Construction

DFA â†’ Minimized DFA: Using Hopcroftâ€™s Algorithm

Graph Rendering: With graphviz.Digraph to a .png

GUI Display: Shown inside a Tkinter window using PIL

## Requirements
Install dependencies using pip:

`pip install graphviz pillow`

## System Requirements:

`Python 3.8+`
graphviz installed and added to system PATH (for rendering images)

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt install graphviz

On Windows :
Install Graphviz from the official website and add it to PATH.

ðŸ§ª Example Inputs
You can test with the following regex/alphabet pairs:

Regex	Alphabet
a*b	a b
`a	b`
`(a	b)*abb`
ab+c	a b c

## How to Run

python toa.py
A GUI window will open. Enter your regex and alphabet, click Convert to DFA, and view the resulting minimized DFA graph and transitions.

## File Structure

toa.py                   # Main application (logic + GUI)
output.png               # Generated DFA image (auto-deleted after display)

## Library Versions Used

tkinter	Built-in (Python standard library)
Pillow	10.3.0
graphviz	0.20.1
Python	3.10.x+ recommended
